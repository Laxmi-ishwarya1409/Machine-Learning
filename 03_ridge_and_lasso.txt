->The goal of linear regression is to find a straight line:
                 𝑦=𝑚𝑋+𝑐

-> It does this by minimizing the Cost Function (MSE):
                𝐽=1/𝑛∑(𝑦𝑖−y predicted)²

-> But sometimes, when we have:

        too many features (independent variables)
        noisy or correlated data

-> the model overfits — it performs great on training data but poorly on unseen data.






Overfitting & Underfitting

    -> In machine learning, when we train a regression model (like Linear Regression), we want it to work well on new unseen data, not just on the training data.

    ➤ Overfitting:

        -> Model fits training data too perfectly — passes through almost every point.

        -> It performs great on training data but bad on new/test data.

        -> So we say:
                Low bias (fits training data well)

                High variance (fails on new data)

    ➤ Underfitting:

        -> Model cannot even fit the training data properly.

        -> It performs bad on both training and test data.

        -> So,we say:
                High bias

                High variance

➤ Goal:

    -> We want a generalized model → performs well on both training and test data.






Regularization (Ridge & Lasso)

    -> Regularization is a technique to prevent overfitting.

    -> It slightly penalizes large coefficients (slope values) in the model so that the line doesn’t become too steep.



Without Regularization:
    -> The model only cares about minimizing error:

            𝐽=1/2𝑚∑(𝑦 𝑖−𝑦 predicted)2

    -> This can make the model too flexible.

With Regularization
    -> We tell the model: Don’t just minimize error — also keep your coefficients small

    -> So we add a penalty term:
        
        𝐽=1/2𝑚∑(𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 predicted)2 + 𝜆 x Penalty

        Here:
            𝜆 = Regularization strength/ the hyper parameter : (how much penalty you give i.e, how fast lessesn the steepness and grow the steepness)

            Penalty = depends on L1 or L2

    Role of λ (Lambda) 

        -> λ = 0 → no regularization (normal linear regression)

        -> λ = large → too much penalty (underfitting)

        -> λ = small but > 0 → just right (balances fit & simplicity)















There are two main types:
1.Ridge Regression → L2 Regularization

    -> Ridge Regression adds the sum of squares of coefficients (weights) to the cost function.
            𝐽=1/𝑛∑(𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 predicted)² + 𝜆 ∑𝑤𝑗² 
 
            where:
                𝜆 = regularization strength (hyperparameter)
                𝑤𝑗 = model coefficients (slopes)
                𝜆∑𝑤𝑗² = L2 penalty term

            -> Intuition:

                -> Keeps all features but shrinks coefficients toward 0.

                -> Reduces the impact of less important features.

                -> Helps when there’s multicollinearity (correlated features).

    Therefore Ridge says : Don’t remove any feature, but keep their weights small and balanced.
    Main Purpose: Prevents Overfitting



2. Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)

    -> Lasso Regression adds the sum of absolute values of coefficients to the cost function.
            𝐽=1/𝑛∑(𝑦𝑖−𝑦 predicted)²+𝜆∑∣𝑤𝑗∣
            
            
    Intuition:

        -> Can force some coefficients to become exactly 0.

        -> This means it automatically selects important features and eliminates irrelevant ones.
        
        -> Great for feature selection.

    Therefore Lasso says: I’ll keep only the most important features and make the rest 0."

    Main Purpose: Prevents Overfitting and good feature selection
