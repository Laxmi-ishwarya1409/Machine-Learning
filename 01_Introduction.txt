1.Introduction to AI, ML, DL, Data Science:
    Artificial Intelligence (AI):
        -> AI is a process of creating applications or systems that can perform tasks without human intervention. It enables machines to think, learn, and make decisions on their own based on data or previous experiences.

        -> AI systems understand user behavior and take actions automatically.

        -> Examples: Netflix recommendation system, self-driving cars, Amazon’s product suggestions.

    Machine Learning (ML):
        -> ML is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time.

        -> It provides statistical tools to analyze, visualize, and make predictions or forecasts based on data. 

        -> Examples: email spam filtering

    Deep Learning (DL):
        -> DL is a subset of ML that mimics the human brain using multi-layered neural networks.

        -> These deep neural networks automatically extract complex patterns and features from large datasets to train models or applications.

        -> Examples: Facial recognition, speech-to-text systems, autonomous driving.

2.Types of ML
    Supervised Learning
    -> In supervised learning, the model is trained using labeled data — i.e., the data contains both input (features) and output (target).
    The model learns to map input to output based on examples.

    -> Goal:To predict outputs for new data based on what it learned from training data.

    -> Key Concepts: Independent feature (X): Input variable(s), Dependent feature (Y): Output variable (label)

    -> Examples:Predicting house prices (Regression),Email spam detection (Classification), Weather forecasting





    Types of Supervised Learning Problems:

    Regression:
        -> When the output variable is continuous.
        Example: Predicting salary, temperature, or weight.
        Algorithms: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree Regressor.


    Classification:
        -> When the output variable is categorical (discrete classes).
        Example: Pass/Fail, Spam/Not Spam, Disease/No Disease.
        Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN.








    Unsupervised Learning
        -> In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on unlabeled data — i.e., only input features are provided, with no predefined output.The model tries to find hidden patterns or structure in the data.

        -> Goal:To discover groups, relationships, or dimensional reductions within data.

    Types of Unsupervised Learning
        Clustering:
            -> Groups similar data points into clusters.
            
            -> Example: Customer segmentation, Market grouping.
            
            -> Algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN.


        Dimensionality Reduction:
            -> Reduces the number of features while retaining important information.
            -> Example: Reducing 1000 features to 100 using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis).
            -> Example Use Cases:Grouping customers by spending behavior, Detecting anomalies in data, Compressing large datasets for faster computation.






3.ML Work Flow

    Data Collection (we gather raw data from different sources like Databases, CSV files, APIs, Web scraping, Sensors, etc.The quality and quantity of data affect model performance.)
            ↓
    Data Preprocessing (Before using the data, we must clean and prepare it. Steps are: Handling missing values, Removing duplicates, Encoding categorical data, Feature scaling / normalization, Splitting into training and testing sets)
            ↓
    Modeling (Training ; we choose a Machine Learning Algorithm and train it on the preprocessed data. The goal is to make a model that learns patterns from data to make predictions.)
            ↓
    Evaluation (After training, we test how well the model performs using test data. The goal is to choose the model with the best accuracy and lowest error.)
            ↓
    Deployment (Once the model performs well, it is deployed into a real-world environment (e.g., website, app, or API, Users can now interact with it and get predictions.)
